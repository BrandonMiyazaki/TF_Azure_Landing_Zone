This repository contains sample Terraform code for deploying a Azure services. The resources and services in this repo are geared towards letting users practice building a working foundation in infrastructure as code. These Landing Zone moduels are designed to help a user develop CAF management groups and a connectivity landing zone built around Azure Virtual WAN. This will deploy also deploy multiple vNets and VMs so a user can simulate and validate connectity across the environment. 

This code can be freely used and expanded upon to build your own environments! I hope you find this code helpful to utilize in your learning journey. Please be mindful that deploying these resource will encure charges against cloud environment so be sure to delete resources when finished.

Note that I do not actively maintain this repo.
