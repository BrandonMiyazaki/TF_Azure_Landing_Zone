This repository contains sample Terraform code for deploying Azure services. The resources and services in this repo are geared towards letting users practice building a working foundation in infrastructure as code. 

This code can be freely used and expanded upon to build your own environments! I hope you find this code helpful to utilize in your learning journey.

Please note that I do not actively maintain this repo.
